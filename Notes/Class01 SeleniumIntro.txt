Selenium Class 1

What is software testing?
-- identifying the correctness and quality of the application
- testers find issues, developers fix them

How many ways can we actually test?
-- manual - done 1st before the automation. jira, task cases, step-by-step procedure
-- automation

When do we go for automation?
-- after manual testing is passed
-- when environment (test environment) is stable
-- analyze our test suite and choose our automation tools

What automation tools do we know about?
-- Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Katalon Studio, UFT/QTP - for web applications
- Appium - is for mobile apps

Level of testing
-- Unit testing - performed by the devs
-- Integration testing - performed by devs mostly
-- Acceptance testing - performed by the clients
-- System testing - performed by testers

Types of testing?
-- Functional testing - performing to see the functionality of each and every application we're working on
-- NON-Functional testing
    Performance testing - how the system works, what is the performance time
    Security testing - we're testing if it is hackable, checking firewalls


What is Selenium?
- why named "Selenium" - The person who invented it wanted to destroy the other tool, called mercury
-- a set of tools which helps us to automate web applications. It is mainly used
to perform functional testing

What is Selenium used for?
-

Selenium has 4 Components:
Selenium IDE --> integrated development environment
Selenium Grid --> Firefox plugin
Selenium WebDriver --> most updated tool
Selenium RC --> Remote control

What is selenium webdriver?
Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on a web applications
WebDriver is an Interface (where we'll be getting all the build-in methods and applying our actions for web applications)

Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- Open source (free)
-- works with different browsers and supports cross browsing testing
-- works with different programming languages --> Java, javaScript, Ruby, Python
-- OS independent --> iOS, Windows, Linux

Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- Cannot test desktop applications
-- no technical support
-- no built-in reports, no feedback
-- cannot test captchas(is security), images or videos (are design) - done by manual testing only
** captcha - a program or system intended to distinguish human from machine input,
   typically as a way of thwarting spam and automated extraction of data from websites.

get() vs navigate().to()
-- navigate can go back and forward and refresh
-- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see the control panel(back and forward, bookmarks)
-- fullscreen() will maximize the whole application


*** If you get an error  saying that
    " driver executable doesn't exist"
    U need to check your path to driver in system.property()
    Remember  it is also case-sensitive
