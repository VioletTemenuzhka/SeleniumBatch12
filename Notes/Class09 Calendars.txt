Selenium Class 9

Pagination - Tables divided into several pages, the navigation bar is called Pagination

Calendars:
    Also known as day pickers
    All calendars will include tables

    StaleElementReferenceException - the worse exception; you don't know where is the error. Element was fine before
    now something changed
     interview question of the day --> stale element reference exception.
    *anything causes reload/refresh the whole page (ex: click to nextpage);
    *webdriver is not able to retrieve the elements of the page we already located because page is reloaded/refreshed (not table itselfs, whole page)
    *the elements we located are changed. selenium forgets about them. because the referenced web element is no longer attached to the DOM.
    *if we want to avoid from that exception on refresh/reload situation, we need to get/locate every element after each refresh/reload again.
    *we can use loop so that we can get webelements every time we are going through the loop.
