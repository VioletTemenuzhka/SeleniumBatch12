WebElements and Locators

What is a WebElement?
WebElement - anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webElement
e.g. buttons, background, textboxes, checkboxes, links

Whenever we're on the page --> right click and go to inspect
Each and every element is identified in the HTML

HTML - HyperText Markup Language where we start to design our website
    language with which we can design
DOM - Document Object Module - This is the browser's internal view of the webpage
Also called a Developer's tools or Dev tools
Document --> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel..
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator - It is an address or position of an webElement on the web page
It is used to locate or identify WebElements on the web page

8 Locators:
1) ID - unique
2) Name
3) Xpath
4) TagName
5) LinkText
6) PartialLinkText
7) CSS Selector
8) ClassName

HTML scripting Meaning:
purple color - tags || button, input, div ..
brown color - attributes || name, class, id
blue color - attribute value

Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different elements
!! If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will interact only with the 1st element it finds
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we're looking for
e.g. linkText and partialLinkText are only used for links
"a" tag is also called an anchor tag
