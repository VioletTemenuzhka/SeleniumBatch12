Selenium Class 10

How to handle Calendars:
1. Click on the calendar
2. Locate the month and get its text
3. If the desired text is not visible --> keep clicking on next and updating the text of the month (in the while loop)
4. as soon as we found our desired mont --> grab all the cells from the table data (store it in a list)
5. Loop through the cells
6. once the cell value is matched our condition --> click on the matched date

Taking screenshots while using Selenium
Why do we need screenshots in testing?
    Screenshots are very important in order to prove that our test cases covered certain functionality.
In Selenium in order to take screenshots we'll be using TakesScreenshot interface
Use try/catch in java

 TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver; //downcasted to the driver, because driver is the complete focus of the browser
 File srcFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);//mention output type; getting a file in return
 //line 23 assign the getScreenshotAs() method to an object of the File class --> the screenshot is taken

 // whenever copyFile() gets executed it may throw an exception --> more actions and surrounded with try/catch
     try {
      FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile,new File("screenshots/SmartBear/adminLogin111.png"));
      } catch (IOException e) { //IOException
      e.printStackTrace();
        }
       // screenshots/SmartBear/ --> these 2 folders will be created automatically and it will store it inside our project
       // adminLogin.png --> name of the file can be anything, extension have to be .png or .jpg
         // if we use the same name over and over, it's going to overwrite every time on the previous one
