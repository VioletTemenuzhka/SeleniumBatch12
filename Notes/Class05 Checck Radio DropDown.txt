Selenium Class 5

radio buttons:
    - only one option can be selected
    - can not uncheck

Check boxes:
    square box
    - can select more than one option
    - can be unchecked

Handling checkboxes and radiobutton:
-- if you have only 1 checkbox or radiobutton - you can just click on it
-- if you have multiple choices - store them in list and loop through

** when we use List it will store the elements in an array list

Dropdown menu:
-- it is a menu which gives us the opportunity to select one or multiple options
Types of dropdowns:
    1. Single select
    2. Multiple select - check manually if it can be multiple selected; we can select and deselect

Handling dropdowns: (how to interact)
    1. click on dropdown and click on the option
    2. using Select class
            - in order to use it we need to make sure that the dropdown we have to test have the
            select tag in the DOM
    If we don't have select tag, use a list and loop trough to find the one you need
Selecting an option from, the dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
    1. By index - indexing starts from 0 zero; there may be some disabled options (they count also)
    2. By visible text - by the first end text which is visible in the dropdown/most preferable way
    3. By value - look in the DOM for the value attribute

Deselecting an option from, the dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
    1. By index - indexing starts from 0 zero; there may be some disabled options (they count also)
    2. By visible text - by the first end text which is visible in the dropdown/most preferable way
    3. By value - look in the DOM for the value attribute
We can select or deselect all

    Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container such as List, Set, Map ...

HW loop through all radiobuttons and then select
