------------- Radio Buttons ----------------

unique access to webElements
We can use multiple attributes to get a unique path
    Those operators can be used in Xpath and in css selector maybe
    use "and" operator
    we can use "or" operator also
    Example: //input[@name='optradio'and@value='Female']
    this also can be a path to find the element, if it is working

    //div[contains(text(),'Radio Button Demo')]//parent::div//label[contains(text(),'Female')]//input
